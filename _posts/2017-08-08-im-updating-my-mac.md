title: I'm updating my Mac
---

Well, it's time for updates. I was trying to start developing a sd file manager homebrew for the 3DS<!--more-->, and, since I've got a Mac, it is harder to install the libs by terminal. So I thought it was easier if I installed Linux (Ubuntu) to my Mac. I found an USB drive to install it from, an I started injecting the Ubuntu 17.04 x64 to it. I also installed rEFInd, a boot manager. I tried to restart my Mac (MacBook Pro 13" Retina early 2015) from the drive with no luck. After trying many times, I realised that rEFInd could load Windows installations without problems. I found a guide on the net on how to install Windows 10 on an external hard disk without using Boot Camp. By using the Windows 7 AIK on my brother's Windows PC, I started injecting a complete windows partition to my HD. As of this writing, it is injecting "_install.wim_"
