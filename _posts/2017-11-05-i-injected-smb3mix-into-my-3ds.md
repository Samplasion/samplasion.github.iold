[SMB]: Super Mario Bros.
[CFW]: Custom Firmware
Yesterday I got SMB 3Mix in my Nintendo 3DS<!--more-->, injected in a `.cia` by a program called **Ultimate NES VC Injector for 3DS**. What this program basically does is, in order, taking a `.nes` rom, taking its data from a database or custom data _(title, short title, publisher and icon)_, selecting a banner, a Title ID and a screen mode and, finally, injecting it all in a CFW-installable `.cia`.
